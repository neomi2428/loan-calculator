## Milestone

* ~~Simple ui with input and button tags.~~
* Use graphic chart to display result using d3.
* Replace an input tag with a horizontal scroll bar.
* Add another section for monthly saving to compare.

    There would be one input of monthly saving amount. In the beginning of mortgage terms, principle is much lower than interest. If I loan a house and sell the house in a few years, I do have one third of my total payment. In the short term, saving would be better than mortgage. If I know the amount of monthly saving, I can compare which one would be better in a specific terms of loan.

```For example, I paid $60K in 5 years and sell the house. I would have $20K. If I can save at least $333 per month, I do not need to loan a house.
